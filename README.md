# Maze Generation and Solver

## Overview

This project provides an implementation of a maze generation algorithm and a maze solver in C. The maze is generated using a randomized algorithm, and the solver uses a depth-first search (DFS) approach to find a path through the maze.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Generates a maze using the Randomized Prim's algorithm.
- **Maze Solving:** Solves the maze using the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm.
- **File I/O:** Saves the generated maze to a file and loads it for solving.
- **Path Visualization:** Visualizes the solved path.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
